Additional Evaluation Results
*****************************

Introduction
============
In additon to the transformation frost shown in the paper, we also conducted an additional set of evaluation using the transformation brightness. 
Because of page limit of the paper, we show them here.

RQ1

  :alt: results for RQ1 specific to brightness

As we can see in the image, our composed threshold is always the lowerbound threshold.

RQ3

RQ3 goes here


Conclusion
----------
Similar to frost shown in the paper, for transformation brightness, 1. we also observe that our composed threshold is a lowerbound; 2. we detected reliability gaps missed by existing benchmarks; 3. by reusing, we can save runtime for checking requirements satisfaction.
